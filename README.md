# korean-EasyOCR

This code is based on EasyOCR.
I tried to fine tune with training data that I generated myself.
It is used only for korean OCR.

## EasyOCR
EasyOCR is a python module for extracting text from image. It is a general OCR that can read both natural scene text and dense text in document. We are currently supporting 80+ languages and expanding.
